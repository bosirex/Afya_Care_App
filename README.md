I am working on the project alone so I didn’t have any team member.

## Technologies
Using mobile applications appears to be more effective given that it eliminates the need to purchase a second device and because the majority of consumers use smartphones. In this project, the decision was made to use Android as the operating system, as it is one of the most popular smartphone operating systems. According to experts in the field, Android is highly effective in mobile devices . This is because it offers an Open-Source platform, that is, Android is an open-source operating system, which means its source code is freely available for developers to modify and customize. This openness allows for greater flexibility, innovation, and customization options compared to closed-source systems like iOS. Moreover, android offers customizability and personalization. Android offers a high level of customizability, allowing users to personalize their devices according to their preferences. Users can customize home screens, widgets, launchers, and themes, creating a unique and tailored experience. These features make it an ideal choice for developing a medication reminder application.
Android's popularity can be attributed to its accessibility, affordability, and user-friendliness. It is used by a large percentage of smartphone users worldwide and is constantly being updated to meet the evolving needs of its users. Additionally, Android has a vast selection of applications available on its platform, making it easy for users to find and download medication reminder applications. Besides, this proposed system will offer device diversity. Because the Afya-Care application will be developed using Android, it will run on a wide variety of devices, ranging from smartphones and tablets to smart TVs, smartwatches, and even cars. This device diversity provides users with a broad selection of hardware options at various price points, accommodating different budgets and user needs. Fundamentally, the application uses an automated alarm ringing mechanism to remind patients or users to take their medication at the proper time and in actual quantity. Also, this proposed system has streaks to help the patient to maintain the medicine pattern and easily track his or her progress. In case the patient skips a day, he or she can reach out to the doctor for further directives. In addition, in case they are not feeling well, have an adverse reaction to the treatment or any medical complications, they can also promptly schedule an appointment with the doctor.

## Challenge
### Technical Challenge:
One of the most formidable technical challenges encountered in developing an automated Android-based medication reminder application lies in ensuring real-time synchronization and data integrity. Medication schedules are critical and must be accurately reflected on both the patient's device and any other connected devices, such as wearables or family members' devices. Achieving seamless synchronization while considering potential network inconsistencies, intermittent connectivity, and data conflicts is a complex task.
Implementing a robust backend infrastructure to support data synchronization, managing conflicts, and ensuring the security and privacy of health-related information demands a sophisticated understanding of cloud computing, data storage, and network protocols. Addressing issues like data concurrency and conflicts, especially when multiple users might update or access medication information simultaneously, requires careful design and implementation of synchronization algorithms.
Moreover, accommodating various Android device specifications, versions, and form factors poses additional challenges. Optimizing the application's performance across a diverse range of devices and ensuring a consistent user experience on various screen sizes and resolutions requires meticulous testing and adaptation.

### Non-Technical Challenge:
The most challenging non-technical aspect of developing a medication reminder application revolves around user adherence and behavior change. Convincing users to adopt the app as a reliable tool for medication management demands addressing psychological and behavioral factors.
Understanding user motivation, designing an intuitive user interface, and implementing persuasive features that encourage consistent app usage are paramount. Educating users about the importance of medication adherence and creating a positive user experience to foster long-term engagement are non-trivial tasks. Patient education materials, notifications, and reminders need to strike a balance between being informative and not overly intrusive, respecting individual preferences and privacy concerns.
Additionally, gaining trust in handling sensitive health data is crucial. Building transparent privacy policies, implementing robust security measures, and obtaining necessary certifications are essential to assure users that their health information is handled with the utmost care.
Successful navigation of these non-technical challenges involves collaboration with healthcare professionals, user experience experts, and possibly behavioral psychologists to create a holistic solution that not only functions effectively but also addresses the human aspects of medication adherence and behavior change.
